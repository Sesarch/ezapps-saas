## ✨ Next.js Doesn't Use "index.html"

Modern frameworks like Next.js use:
- **`page.tsx`** instead of `index.html`
- **`layout.tsx`** for the HTML wrapper
- **Components** that compile to HTML

When you run `npm run dev`, Next.js automatically:
1. Compiles everything
2. Creates HTML pages
3. Serves them at localhost:3000

### Want to see it quickly?
**→ Open PREVIEW.html** (double-click)

### Want the full experience?
**→ Run the Next.js version:**
```bash
cd main-site
npm install
npm run dev
```

## 🆘 Still Confused?

**The website IS finished!** It's just built with modern technology (Next.js) instead of traditional HTML.

Think of it like:
- **Old way:** index.html (single file)
- **New way:** Multiple files that work together

Both create the same beautiful website, but the Next.js version is more powerful!
